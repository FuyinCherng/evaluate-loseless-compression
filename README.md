# Survey on Moderm Lossless Compression Methods


## About
Since the online service, digitalization and big data (ok I know this is a overused word) get more and more popular in these years, how to compress large amount of data and segments of data become a crucial problem and challenge for reaching high efficient service and nice user experience. 
In previous years, some of the big companies (Google, Facebook and Apple) open-sourced their compression methods. Therefore, this project want to evaluate whose methods is better and want to provide some guides of how to chose an appropriate compression method. 


## Compression Methods
The compression methods we evaluate are:

- [Snappy (2011, Google)]()
- [Brotli (2015, Google)]()
- [zstd (2015, Facebook)]()
- [LZFSE (2016, Apple)]()



## Compressed Data
The data we compressed: wiki, string...

## Evaluation
The condition of evaluation and how we performe evaluation (device, time of compression....
Follow what we mentioned on the slides 

### Performance Metrics
According to the [Evaluating Compression Effectiveness](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Compression/Evaluating_Compression_Effectiveness#Decompression_Speed), we used the following performance metrics in the evaluation:

- Compression Ratio = 
- Compression Speed () = 
- Decompression Speed () =

## Result
### Formate of dataset
original size \t compressed size \t compression time \t decompression time
